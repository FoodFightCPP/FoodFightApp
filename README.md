## About FoodFight
So here at FoodFight, we are looking to create a mobile application that aims to solve disputes between partners and friends over where to go eat. Have you ever tried to go out to eat and asked, "Where do you want to go?", and the other person responds with, "I don't care'"? Then you suggest somewhere to go and they shoot it down faster than a falling meteor? 
Well with FoodFight, you will be able to connect to users and in real time generate a list of restaurants around your location or a location you setup ahead of time. Then you swipe left or right on the locations to pick ones that you would like to eat at and your friend or partner does the same. When you match on a location that is where you go out to eat! So stop fighting over food and use FoodFight instead!

## About the Devs
There are currently 3 devs working on this project as a capstone to their associates degree for Northwestern Michigan College. All three plan to take this application to market and continue to develop the application after the semester is over and create a real world product that is free to use for the masses. This will require quite a bit of work, but they are confident in their abilities and are passionate about the idea. 

## Project Technology
This project is currently being built with Xamarin.Forms and C# for the android mobile application. Entity Framework will be used to handle the data access and repo's for this application as well. An iOS version is planned in the future, but currently, we are limited in our hardware to properly build and test for the iOS platform. We are also utilizing ASP.NET with MVC for an admin website to help manage the data in the application as well as using Wordpress and Divi 4.0 for the front facing user website. 

## Development Process
This project is being developed with the Agile Development process in mind. We have 5 sprints to utilize for building the application and accompanying websites over the course of 15 weeks. The first 2 sprints have focused on planning and analysis for the different products that we are creating along with diagrams and workflows to put our ideas onto paper before ever touching a line of code. We have roughly 2 sprints to design and implement the application and websites and a final sprint to polish things up, get presentations and videos in order, and to make this a deliverable product to our stakeholder (in this instance our instructor) for final grading. We have utilized GitHubs Kanban board feature with issue tracking to create cards for user stories, setup tasks, etc. as well. Discord is our main communication server for online meetings and discussions outside of class also. 

## Documentation 
User documentation will be available on our website once the application is built, along with a wiki here on GitHub as well. On our website you will find a FAQ section as well with our most commonly asked questions and eventually a community forum to post requests, questions, and more. We will develop appropriate bug submission forms for GitHub as well since this product will be open source and licensed as such so any developers may contribute after May 1st, 2021 once the semester has ended and we have completed our capstone portion. 

## Bug Reports
Forms and proper bug reporting procedures will be developed and posted here on GitHub and inside of the Repo once we have completed the semester after May 1st, 2021 and can open this project up to open source developers. Please stay tuned.

## Additional Information
This project is not a new idea in that it has been floating around the web for a while. We are just building it out since we have not seen any other examples or commercially viable solutions on the market today. We will post additional information here as needed such as links to development blog posts, updates on the application development, and more. Stay tuned and thank you for taking an interest in our project!
